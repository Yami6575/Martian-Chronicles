**Hey guys,I am Nikhil Mishra from s1 cse-d** 

I honestly enjoyed the standby tasks, i leant a lot of stuff,started with the **automate the boring stuff with python** where i started by just brushing of my python and build few basic projects nad later leant abount many liberaries in the second half of the book and build many complex projects which was tough and enjoyable at the same time and now this which was completely new for me i never heard of pyqt or building desktop applilcation through the process if learn to use the pyqt designer efficiently and also to reader the code that it generates with the functionality that i want.

Regards
